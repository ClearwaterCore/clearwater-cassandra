# This script is used by Monit to check connectivity to remote Cassandra
# instances. If connectivity is lost to any instances in the ring an
# alarm will be issued (major severity for a single instance, critical
# severity for more than one instance). When connectivity is restored to
# all instances, the alarm is cleared. Alarms are issued here vs. the Monit
# DSL to avoid retransmissions.
#
# If the local instance is not running, nodetool will fail. In that case
# we do not issue an alarm and return a good status. The Clearwater pro-
# cess using Cassandra is responsible for alarming communication issues
# with the local instance. 
#
# Execution of nodetool is "niced" to minimize the impact of its JVM use.
